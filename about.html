<h1>About HDI</h1>
<p>The Human Development Report includes data for all 193 member states of the United Nations, as well as
 Hong Kong SAR and the State of Palestine. However, the Human Development Index is not calculated for two
UN member states: DPR Korea (North Korea) and Monaco, only some components of the index are calculated
for these two countries. The Cook Islands, the Holy See (Vatican City), and Niue are the only three
state parties within the United Nations System which are not included in the report. In total,
the HDI is available for 192 countries and one territory.
Countries ranked from 1 to 69 in 2022 are designated "very high" HDI; those ranked from 70 to 118
are designated "high" HDI; those ranked from 119 to 159 are denoted "medium" HDI; and those ranked
from 160 to 193 are designated "low" HDI. Table can be found on the Media page on this website.</p><br>
